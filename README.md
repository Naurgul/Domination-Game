We are experimenting with different approaches for the AI of the agents.

Based on an original concept developed by Okke Formsma and Arno Veenstra and an updated version of the framework by Thomas van den Berg and Tim Doolan. http://github.com/noio/Domination-Game/

Please refer to the http://domination-game.rtfd.org/ for information on using this framework.
